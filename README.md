This repository contains scripts to compute current flow betweenness
on a weighted undirected network between a pair of given disjoint
node subsets (source and sink).
There are two versions available, one for R and one for python.
	-R version: R_version/correlation_network_analysis_functions.r
	-python version: python_version/correlation_data_utilities.py
Currently the R version is being phased out in favor of a lightweight
python version.
The python version tutorial is under construction.
Completed:
-Computing flow betweenness on a weighted network matrix

-Repository of trajectory and matrix data used in tutorials
	python_version/trajectoryData
In progress:
-Suboptimal network analysis
