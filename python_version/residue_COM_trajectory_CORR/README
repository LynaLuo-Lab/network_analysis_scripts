This folder contains an ipython notebook that can generate
the contact-correlation matrix for the center of mass motion
for each residue. This requires first writing an appropriate
trajectory of the per residue centers of mass. Next, carma
is used to generate the correlation matrix. This requires
the presence of an appropriate psf file. The psf file is
identical to the one generated by the VMD networkView plugin
when generating an alpha carbon correlation matrix, so this
may need to be run first to obtain the needed psf.

Alternatively, pytraj can be used to compute the correlation
matrix for the COM trajectory as well, the needed code will
be added at a later date.
