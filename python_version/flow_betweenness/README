This folder contains three relevant items
1) A python notebook illustrating the process (good for interactive learning)
2) A python script version of the notebook (must be modified to use on an arbitrary matrix)
3) A python script version that takes 4 command line arguments
	-the name of the input matrix file
	-the name of the desired output flow betweenness matrix file
	-a quoted space separated list of source nodes. i.e. '1 2 3 4'
	-a quoted space separated list of target nodes. i.e. '5 6 7 8'

Note, these scripts assume that input matrix contains a set of normalized non-negative
interaction values. E.g. all values should be between 0 and 1 with 1 corresponding to
maximal (lossless) interaction.

The 'trajectoryData' directory contains all the files needed to generate the
test case matrix here (contact.absCorr) using the VMD networkView plugin.
