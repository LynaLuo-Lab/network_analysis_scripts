The ipython notebook here illustrates how to
use pytraj to generate smoothed contact maps
linear and gaussian smoothing functions are
used as examples but other functions could be
applied as well.
The idea here is to apply a function that maps
the minimum distance between atoms in a given
pair of residues to a function that transitions
smoothly from 0 for no contact to 1 for full
contact rather than use a shap cutoff value.
The functions given here are by no means optimal
and while they appear to significantly stablise
the contact topology, this was later seen to
have relatively little impact on node / edge
ranking based on suboptimal path frequencies.
